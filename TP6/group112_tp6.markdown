## Set 1: Mastering Strcutured Output Formats

### Task 1.1: Output Selection for Prompts
**Format Selection Table**:
| Prompt | Chosen Format | Justification |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Eco-tour Iceland | Markdown List |Need for clarity and flexibility|
| Luxury Cruise | Table | With expensive costs, need for detailed planning of dates, costs, etc. |
| Surprise Getaway | JSON | easy intergration into other software, or simply keeping most of the surprise intact.|

## Set 2: Modular Prompt Systems

### Task 2.1: Modularizing Prompts 
**Prompts**:
**JSON Data**
{
  "city": "Vancouver",
  "days": 5,
  "theme": "Architecture and views"
}
**Prompt for Module 2**
Utilizing the JSON data attached, generate a Markdown table with the following columns: Day, Morning Options, Afternoon Options. For each of the five days, provide 3 morning activity options and three afternoon activity options. All options should relate and align with the theme. Each cell will be a bulleted list. Include no outside commentary or text outside the table.

**Module 3**
Utilizing the data from attached table, generate a Markdown table with the following columns: Day, Morning , Afternoon, Insider Tip. For each of the five days, generate a short and helpful travel tip. All options should relate and align with the theme. Each cell will be a bulleted point, proper formating. Include no outside commentary or text outside the table.

## Reflection
From the tasks done in TP6, I've learned from using data formating like JSON to make prompts more adaptable. Defining key areas in Module 1, clear and coherent data transmission was easily achieved. Additionally, using modular prompt design breaks complex tasks. Each task can then be shifted and adapted to a singular issue, such as changing the "city" data in Module 1. In short, structured data makes AI prompting efficient, clear, and easily identifiable.

**Deliverables**: Markdown file (`group#_week9_reflection.md`) with all task outputs, transcript links, and 100-word reflection.
