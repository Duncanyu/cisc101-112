## **Group Reflection (Required, not graded)**

100 words. Must address:  

- How decomposition, variables, conditionals, loops, CoT, few-shot prompting, context windows, and hallucination mitigation improved robustness.  
- Which were most challenging.  
- Which seem most useful in real-world scenarios.
