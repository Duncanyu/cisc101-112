=================================================

**Grading Rubric (Total = 50 points)**

* * *

**Set 1 – Zero-Shot Prompting (8 points total)**
-------------------------------------------------

### **Task 1.1 – Zero-Shot Prompt and Comparison (8 points)**

* **Prompt Testing Completeness (2 pts)**
  
  * **2:** Both zero-shot and few-shot prompts tested with valid transcript links.
  
  * **1:** Only one tested or link missing.
  
  * **0:** No valid test.

* **Observation of Differences (6 pts)**
  
  * **2+2+2:** Clear, specific comparison of *structure, tone, and clarity* between versions - 2 point for each element of comparison
  
  * **1**: Comparison vague, incomplete - per element
  
  * **0:** Missing.

* * *

**Set 2 – Self-Consistency (15 points total)**
----------------------------------------------

### **Task 2.1 – Self-Consistency Assumption Analysis (15 points)**

* **Transcript Links (3 pts)**
  
  * **1 pt per working link** (3 links expected).

* **Strengths (2 pts)**
  
  * **2:** At least two distinct strengths identified clearly.
  
  * **1:** One strength listed.
  
  * **0:** None.

* **Weaknesses (2 pts)**
  
  * **2:** At least two distinct weaknesses identified clearly.
  
  * **1:** One weakness listed.
  
  * **0:** None.

* **Differences (2 pts)**
  
  * **2:** At least two key differences described between outputs.
  
  * **1:** One difference.
  
  * **0:** None.

* **Selected Itinerary (2 pt)**
  
  * **2:** Chosen itinerary fits client needs and constraints.
  
  * **0:** Missing or poor fit.

* **Justification (4 pt)**
  
  * **4:** Clear rationale for why the chosen itinerary is best.
  
  * **2**: Rationale vague, incomplete
  
  * **0:** No justification.

* * *

**Set 3 – Spec-Based Development (16 points total)**
----------------------------------------------------

### **Task 3.1 – Designing Specifications (6 points)**

* **Inputs (2 pts)**
  
  * **2:** All required inputs clearly defined (e.g., budget, city, dates).
  
  * **1:** Some inputs listed but incomplete or ambiguous.
  
  * **0:** None.

* **Outputs (2 pts)**
  
  * **2:** Expected outputs clearly defined (e.g., daily activities with costs).
  
  * **1:** Partially defined or unclear.
  
  * **0:** None.

* **Constraints (2 pts)**
  
  * **2:** Constraints clearly stated (e.g., budget limit, accessibility, format).
  
  * **1:** Vague or partial.
  
  * **0:** None.

### **Task 3.2 – Writing and Testing a Prompt (10 points)**

* **Prompt Quality (5 pts)**
  
  * **5:** Prompt clearly implements all elements of the written specification (inputs, outputs, constraints) and generates an appropriate “Daily Budget Breakdown.”
  
  * **2:** Prompt partially reflects the specification; one or more elements (inputs, outputs, or constraints) are missing or unclear.
  
  * **0:** Prompt unrelated to or inconsistent with the specification.

* **Evaluation of Results (4 pts)**
  
  * **4:** Explanation explicitly compares the AI output to each part of the specification, highlighting successes and failures.
  
  * **2:** Explanation discusses results generally but omits details or criteria from the specification.
  
  * **0:** No clear evaluation or reflection provided.

* **Transcript link (1 pts)**
  
  * **1:** Working transcript link provided showing both the prompt and resulting output.
  
  * **0:** Transcript missing or link not functional.

* * *

**Set 4 – AI-Assisted Debugging (11 points total)**
---------------------------------------------------

### **Task 4.1 – Debugging with AI Feedback (11 points)**

* **Rubric:**
  
  * **Transcript links (2 pts)**
    
    * **2:** Transcript links for debugging and testing (1 each)
    
    * **1:** Either transcript link missing
    
    * **0:** No transcript links submitted.
  
  * **Issue Identification and AI Feedback Summary (3 pts)**
    
    * **3:** At least three distinct issues from Set 3 clearly listed and summarized along with relevant AI suggestions.
    
    * **2/1:** two/one issues or limited feedback noted.
    
    * **0:** No issues or feedback described.
  
  * **Revised Prompt/Spec and Justification (6 pts)**
    
    * **2+2+2:** Revised prompt/spec directly addresses the identified issues - 2 points for each addressed issue
    
    * **1**: Revision is partial or does not fully address issue, per issue
    
    * **0:** No meaningful revisions or justification provided.

* * *

**Total = 50 points**  
(Reflections are ungraded but must be included for completeness.)
